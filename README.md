pipi.py
=======

My toolkit of helper functions and classes for image processing and computer vision. Most of it is general, but some bits are project-specific. This basically brings Python back to Matlat-levels of convenience in terms of doing simple things quickly (imread, imwrite, etc.) and wraps up commonly used code in more specific domains (e.g. read, write, and visualize optical flow maps).

Installation: I've yet to package it up properly, so just copy or symlink pipi/ into your site-packages directory.

On my ubuntu machine:
ln -s pipi /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
